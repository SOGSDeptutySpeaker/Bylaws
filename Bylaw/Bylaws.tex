        \item One is involved in either the solicitation or rendering of services or products to the Society wherein one stands to make personal financial gains, for instance as a shareholder, contract employee, or investor.
        \item One is participating in the hiring, contract review, or investigation of an immediate relative, spouse, in-law, step-child, or third-party business partner for the Society. 
        \item One places or has placed the needs or demands of a third party or agency above the stated or acknowledged needs of the Society.

		\item Declare one's conflict, and

			\item Recuse oneself from all participation, including administrative, in the activity in which one deems oneself to be in conflict, or
            \item If the conflict of interest is such that one can no longer discharge his/her duties to the Society, one may resign from one's position of authority or influence, provided doing so resolves the conflict in question.
		\end{longenum}
        \item Pursuant to adopting any of the actions therein but only after the fact does not resolve the conflict, and may still result in sanctions or censure (see Bylaw 11.3 below).

        \index{Departmental Grants!Determining Number of Students}

    \item The degree to which a department is said to be ``represented'' at a council meeting is based on the number of councilors recognized as having been in attendance within the ratified SOGS minutes of that meeting, divided by the total number of councilor positions that department has been allocated.

		\item The number of students in a department will be multiplied by \$3.00. 		
        \item The result of the calculation in 2.15.3.19.1 will then be multiplied by that department's total percentage of representation at the term's Council meetings. This will be the dollar amount of the rebate earned that month.
